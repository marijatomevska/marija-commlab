## Project Name: NYUAD Cats
# Project Description: 
The website is dedicated to showcasing the cats at NYUAD. It features a gallery of the feline residents, monthly cat counts, and provides a way to contact the project organizers. The project's overall concept and theme revolve around engaging with and documenting the cat population at NYUAD, aiming to create an informative and engaging experience for visitors interested in the campus's cats.
# Process: 
To implement the concept, the process began with capturing videos on campus to document the number of cats encountered. This initial step merged observation with content creation, leading to a phase of video editing to compile simple yet informative content. Following this, the project transitioned into the website development phase, which was underpinned by thorough research and meticulous planning. Decisions regarding the website's aesthetics, such as color schemes and layout, were made to ensure the final product was both visually appealing and user-friendly, encapsulating a creative journey from concept to execution.

# Reflection/Evaluation: 
The project's culmination effectively encapsulated the initial concept, fulfilling the expe#ctations and goals set at its inception. The process of documenting, planning, and creatively constructing the website not only realized the envisioned digital space for NYUAD's cats but also underscored the importance of such community-centric projects. The final working version stands as a testament to the harmonious blend of purposeful content creation and aesthetic design, showcasing a successful endeavor from concept to completion.
