    <div class = "video-descr"><p>The intent behind the monthly count of cats on the website is to track and document the fluctuating population of cats at NYUAD. This effort aims to provide a dynamic and engaging way for the community to connect with and stay informed about the campus's feline residents. By updating these counts regularly, the project highlights the ongoing presence and significance of cats within the university environment, fostering a sense of connection and awareness among students, faculty, and visitors alike. </p></div>
